Mascot was created to let my ultimate frisbee team know about the game schedule and our weekly standing. Every week, hours prior to the game, I am in charge of letting my team know who we're playing against, the colour jersey to wear, and the field number to play at. Now, with this idea, I can hopefully make it easier to inform everyone.

Currently, I am able to scrape using Beautiful Soup from the league website itself (https://perpetualmotion.org/ultimate-schedules-and-standings/) to obtain our weekly schedule and standings.
