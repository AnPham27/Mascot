Mascot was created to let my ultimate frisbee team know about the game schedule and our weekly standing. Every week, I am in charge of letting my team know who we're playing against, the colour jersey to wear, and the field number to play at. Now, with this idea, I can hopefully make it easier to inform everyone.

Currently, I am able to scrape using Beautiful Soup from the league website itself (https://perpetualmotion.org/ultimate-schedules-and-standings/) to obtain our weekly schedule and standings. 

Some useful commands: 
!standing = shows the current standing with the team's places, wins, losses, and points/spirit points (spirit points aren't posted until Saturday at 3pm, so I scraped points)
!schedule = shows the information of the present day's games (we can check the day of)
!upcoming_schedule = user can type a date to check if we have any games that day, and if we do, it will inform the opponent team, colour jersey, and field number
